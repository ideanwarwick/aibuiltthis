<h1>AI Built This</h1>

<p>Welcome to a meta-documentation project: a website documenting its own creation by an AI agent.</p>

<h2>The Concept</h2>

<p>This entire website was built using only an AI agent (Strawberry), with a human simply providing decisions and approvals. Every line of code, every design choice, and every deployment step is documented.</p>

<h2>Tech Stack</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Static Site Generator:</strong> Eleventy (11ty)</li>
  <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> GitHub</li>
  <li><strong>Hosting:</strong> Stormkit</li>
  <li><strong>Design:</strong> Minimal black and white aesthetic</li>
  <li><strong>Domain:</strong> aibuiltthis.site</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why This Matters</h2>

<p>As AI tools become more capable, understanding what they can build — and how — becomes crucial. This project is a transparent, step-by-step demonstration of what's possible when an AI agent has access to development tools.</p>
