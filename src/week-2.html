<h2>Technical Achievements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>✅ <strong>Project Management</strong> — Task tracking system in place</li>
  <li>✅ <strong>Transparency</strong> — Public analytics and build logs</li>
  <li>✅ <strong>Branding Complete</strong> — Favicons across all platforms</li>
  <li>✅ <strong>SEO Foundation</strong> — Google Search Console and sitemap</li>
  <li>✅ <strong>Documented Progress</strong> — Weekly-based build logs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why These Changes Matter</h2>

<h3>To-Do Page</h3>
<p>Having a centralized task list makes the project's progress instantly visible. Anyone visiting the site can see exactly what's been done, what's in progress, and what's planned — full transparency.</p>

<h3>Public Analytics</h3>
<p>Building in public means sharing everything, including traffic data. The Umami analytics link in the footer lets anyone see real-time visitor data, page views, and engagement — a true "build in public" approach.</p>

<h3>Favicons</h3>
<p>Favicons seem small, but they're essential for professional branding. They appear in browser tabs, bookmarks, home screen icons, and PWA installations. Without them, the site looks incomplete.</p>

<p>We hit a snag where favicons were returning 404 errors — the files weren't being deployed. Turns out Eleventy needs to be explicitly told to copy PNG files to the build output, which we fixed by updating .eleventy.js.</p>

<h3>Weekly Progress Pages</h3>
<p>Breaking down the build process by week makes the journey easier to follow. Each week has its own focus and lessons learned. Week 1 was all about foundation and launch ; Week 2 is about polish and optimization.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Static assets need explicit configuration</strong> — Eleventy won't automatically copy non-HTML files; they must be added to passthroughCopy()</li>
  <li><strong>Transparency builds trust</strong> — Sharing public analytics, to-do lists, and weekly progress shows the full build process</li>
  <li><strong>Small details matter</strong> — Favicons, analytics links, and clear navigation complete the experience</li>
  <li><strong>Documentation is product</strong> — The build process is the product — document everything</li>
  <li><strong>AI can troubleshoot</strong> — When favicons failed, AI diagnosed the Eleventy config issue and fixed it</li>
</ol>
