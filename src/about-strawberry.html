<h1>About Strawberry Browser</h1>

<p>This entire website was built using <strong>Strawberry Browser</strong> — a revolutionary agentic browser that turns web browsing into an intelligent, automated experience.</p>

<h2>What is Strawberry Browser?</h2>

<p>Strawberry is an AI-powered browser that doesn’t just display websites—it interacts with them. It’s like having an intelligent assistant that can research, navigate, extract data, and even build websites — all through conversation.</p>

<h2>Why It’s Fantastic</h2>

<h3>1. True Agentic Browsing</h3>
<p>Unlike traditional browsers, strawberry doesn’t just show you webpages—it understands them. Tell it what you want, and it’ll:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Navigate across multiple websites</li>
  <li>Fill out forms and input data</li>
  <li>Click buttons and interact with UIs</li>
  <li>Extract and compile information</li>
  <li>Automate repetitive tasks</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. No Code Required</h3>
<p>You don’t need to program or write any code. Just tell Strawberry what you want in plain English, and it handles the rest. This entire website was built through conversational instructions—no manual coding, no command line scripts.</p>

<h3>3. Real Web Automation</h3>
<p>Strawberry didn’t just generate static code. It:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Navigated to GitHub and created the repository</li>
  <li>Committed files directly to the repo</li>
  <li>Configured DNS records on Moreweb</li>
  <li>Updated documentation in real-time</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Browser-Based Development</h3>
<p>No need for terminal commands, local development environments, or complex setups. Everything happened directly in the browser—from domain registration to deployment.</p>

<h3>5. Intelligent Problem Solving</h3>
<p>When builds failed, Strawberry didn’t just report errors. It:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Analyzed error logs</li>
  <li>Identified root causes (missing files, typos)</li>
  <li>Executed fixes automatically</li>
  <li>Documented everything for future reference</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Multi-Task Orchestration</h3>
<p>Strawberry can spin up multiple agents in parallel, each working on different tasks simultaneously. It’s like having an entire team of assistants working for you.</p>

<h2>How This Site Was Built</h2>

<p>Every step was accomplished through conversation with Strawberry:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Domain Research:</strong> Searched availability across multiple registrars</li>
  <li><strong>Purchase Assistance:</strong> Navigated Moreweb to purchase the domain</li>
  <li><strong>GitHub Setup:</strong> Created repository and committed all files</li>
  <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Configured GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages</li>
  <li><strong>Error Resolution:</strong> Debugged and fixed build failures</li>
  <li><strong>DNS Configuration:</strong> Added all necessary records to point to GitHub Pages</li>
  <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Created and updated docs in real-time</li>
</ol>
